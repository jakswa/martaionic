This is where the common UI lives for http://marta.io and its sister mobile apps (on [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.martaionic451202) and [iOS](itunes.apple.com/us/app/marta.io/id1082012161)). I'm so new to ionic that I don't know the official instructions for
cloning and running this locally, but I bet it's close to something like:

1. Clone the repo, `cd` into it
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm install -g ionic cordova`
3. run `ionic serve` and follow directions (might need to install a couple more things, I forget)
